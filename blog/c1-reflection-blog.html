    <h1>Chat with Shereef</h1>
    <h1>A reflection on Shereefs video </h1>
    
    
    <h3>QUESTION 1. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE EDA/DBC EXPERIENCE?</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy the flexibilty on peoples learning experience as all people learn differently. in my personal 
      experiance i did not recieve this kind of learning during school so I am very excited to see what the 
      boot camp has in store for this.
    </p>
    <h3>QUESTION 2. WHAT ARE YOUR IMPRESSIONS? </h3>
    <p>
        Shereefs insight on the course is very observational. i enjoyed his explanation on how 
        people on different levels with coding can all do well on the same course. 
        it was also good to have that put into perspective with the fact that coding is a long journey 
        and the people that seem to be miles ahead still have a long way to go compared to the teachers
        and other long standing developers.
    </p>
    <h3>QUESTION 3. HOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF ENGAGING WITH THIS CULTURE? </h3>
    <p>
      I look forward to learning along side other people and i think this culture will help me to grow
      with knowledge of code and the ability to work efficiently and well in a group.
    </p>
    <h3>QUESTION 4. HAVE YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF EDA CHANGED? </h3>
    <P>
        My EDA expectations have not changed to much as i have been informed from the get go from the 
        interview process and phone calls. and also from word of mouth from prior students. 
        Although i am becoming more informed as I go andit is exciting.
    </P>
    <h3>QUESTION 5 ARE YOU EXCITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS KIND OF ENVIRONMENT? DOES IT MAKE YOU NERVOUS?</h3>
    <p>
        I am both very nervous and very excited to participate in the environment as i wont know how well i will 
        perform untill i am in the thick of it.
