    </p>
    <h3>QUESTION 3. what worked for you?  </h3>
    <p>
      The pomodoro method worked for me as it was fast and easy to start getting the hang of.
      and it stops me losing focus as often as I had been.

    <h3>QUESTION 4. which will you experiment further with?  </h3>
    <P>
        the habits of succesfull people is something i would like to try as the title speaks for itself.
        habits are something that take a while to form so i would like to put a bit of time in to accumulating such habbits.
