      <h3>Analogy to describe HTML,CSS and DOM? </h3>
      <p> I will use a painting as an analogy for my explanation.
          First you will sketch what it is you are going to paint. this is the fundamental 
          structure and has all the content this is html. the next is css. css can be 
          described as the color added to the canvas brightning the painting up making it look
          nice. and the last part is dom. the dom is the brushes and paints used to
          modify the painting.
