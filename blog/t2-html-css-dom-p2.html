      <h3> What is grid based design</h3>
      <p> grid based design is a structure used to help people easily follow the information \
          on the page. its used in newspapers and on most webpages. it lays out the information from left 
        to right and usually starts with a title followed by a heading then sometimes an image 
        and last but not least the content/ paragraph </p>
      
      <h3> What's all the hype about a responsive webpage?</h3>
      <p>responsive webpages are very neccesary in this day and age as people are using
          all sorts of different sized screens. from phones to tablets to large p.c monitors. 
          responsiveness allows the page to adapt to new sizes while still portraying the same
        information.  </p>

        <h3> What is a semantic structure </h3>
        <p>semantic tags are used to make things stand out i.e with the header tags.
           you can also use them to add images. semantic elements accurately describe 
           the meaning of the tag.
