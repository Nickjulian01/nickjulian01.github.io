        <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
        <p> There were 5 key points at the start of the reading on emotional intelligence.
            1. Self-awareness: Knowledge of one’s internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions
            2. Self-regulation: Management of one’s internal states, impulses, and resources
            3. Motivation: Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals
            4. Empathy: Awareness of others’ feelings, needs, and concerns
            5. Social skills: Adeptness at inducing desirable responses in others.

            Emotional intelligence enables three important skill sets: stellar work performance, 
            outstanding leadership, and the ability to create the conditions for happiness.

            Emotional intelligence is trainable

            Training your attention is the foundation for emotional intelligence.
            The reading gives two easy exercises for training attention.
            1. Focus on just breathing for two minutes. everytime your attention wanders bring it back
            2. The second one being even easier is to sit with no agenda for 2 minutes.

        <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness? </h3>
        <p> The two minutes of mindfulness were quite peaceful and easy to complete although my mind 
            does love to try and wander so i will need to practise everyday in order to get better.
