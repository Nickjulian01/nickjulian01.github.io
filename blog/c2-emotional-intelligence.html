        <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
        <p> There were 5 key points at the start of the reading on emotional intelligence.</p>
        <p> 1. Self-awareness: Knowledge of one’s internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions </p>    
        <p> 2. Self-regulation: Management of one’s internal states, impulses, and resources</p>    
        <p> 3. Motivation: Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals</p>    
        <p> 4. Empathy: Awareness of others’ feelings, needs, and concerns</p>    
        <p> 5. Social skills: Adeptness at inducing desirable responses in others.</p>    

        <p> Emotional intelligence enables three important skill sets: stellar work performance, 
            outstanding leadership, and the ability to create the conditions for happiness.</p>

        <p> Emotional intelligence is trainable</p> 

        <p>Training your attention is the foundation for emotional intelligence.</p>    
        <p>The reading gives two easy exercises for training attention.</p>    
        <p>1. Focus on just breathing for two minutes. everytime your attention wanders bring it back</p>
        <p>2. The second one being even easier is to sit with no agenda for 2 minutes.</p>    
        

        <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness? </h3>
        <p> The two minutes of mindfulness were quite peaceful and easy to complete although my mind 
            does love to try and wander so i will need to practise everyday in order to get better.
